# First Week Project Idea And Future Perspective 

Hi I am Sagar Kalyan.
This is my first blog on my project A.

Week 1 PROJECT A: Python

I have chosen this topic of my best interest because of several reasons:
1. The main purpose for selecting this topic is to build a web application on my profile based.
2. As, I researched on google about this programming language its popularity is increasing and surpasses PHP programming language.
I have good knowledge in PHP and MySQL, and therefore it would be more better for me if i learn to build some new application with Django framework. As lots of popular companies uses this Application framework Programming based on Python like Instagram, Youtube, Spotify and many more.
3. Its easier and faster (Simple Syntax Used). Involves less code, less time and money. Therefore, It's communicative code.

THe main reason is to build an effective web application for my personal blogging platform and creating an e-commerce system for selling ebooks, and may be many products if successful. This days its great to be exposed on internet to make yourself exist on digital platform.
I have recently started my own youtube channel. Initially, It will also help in getting a job based on this profile. Right now, my focus is on learning and developing skills and gaining confidence to make myself better, So that i could also inspire many people and share whatever i have learnt in life.

THis programming language will support completely my project as it's main feature is to build dynamic web applications and i have to develop the same as lots of popular sites are build on this platform (for eg Youtube). It's an open source platform to start an individual project to build up a scalable system.

I will start with Learning Tutorials, and reading documentation on Python to become familiar with language to use.
Then Install all necessary softwares, if necessary to use. Like Django application.
And lastly, i am going to watch several tutorials related to projects on Youtube and Lynda.com.

Thanks
