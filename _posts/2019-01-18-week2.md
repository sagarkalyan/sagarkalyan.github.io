Personal Blog (Django framework)

Before starting out building a website, i would like you to know some basic things i have done this week:
1. Installed Python and Django framework latest version.
2. Learned basic knowledge of using terminal.
3. Basic programming language Python (Syntax and concept step by step)
Sources: 
         a) https://www.w3schools.com/python/
         b) https://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/
            (Still learning more.)
         
4. Django Framework tutorials on Lynda.com  (Beginners Level)
https://www.lynda.com/Django-tutorials/Building-Personal-Portfolio-Django/761962-2.html

Still Working on it.

There were some issues regarding terminal command prompt.So, i took help from video tutorials on youtube.com
and resolved the issue.
The text editor i am using is Pycharm which is really new for me to use. Its really good experience to use.

Plan For My Next Week:
1. I am going to learn the object oriented programming in Python to learn the main concept.
2. Django Framework - This will be my main focus to enhance some more skills to develop some back end structure for my project.
3. I am really exited to make some cool dynamic webpages and may be even add Bootstrap into it.

Thanks. (18-01-2019)
