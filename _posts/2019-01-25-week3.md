# [WEEK 3rd Project Progress on Personal Blog]({% post_url 2019-01-25-week3 %})

This Week i have created some basic templates for my personal blogs and learned some backend development.

 I would like you to know some basic things i have done this week:
 
 1. Django Framework tutorials on Lynda.com (Intermediate Level)
 2. Using HTML, CSS created a basic template to show the result output. Retrieved information from the data base.
 3. Also, Learned How Adminstration Account works on Django Framework. 
 
 There are some issues related to get refering the correct location for including HTML file. To view the Homepage and other post pages. Not clearly understood. I kept on trying several methods which were frustrating me in this part.
 
 Plan For My Next Week:
 1. First Part is complete atleast basic essential portion for my project.
 2. Presentation preparation will be done.
 3. I will figure out to learn some more technical stuffs related to this project. So, that i can include some more features.
 
 Thanks
