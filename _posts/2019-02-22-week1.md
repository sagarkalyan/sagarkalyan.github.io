# [Week 1st Project on React Native]({% post_url 2019-02-22-week1 %})

Hi, This is my first week for the tutorial project on react native app.

Lets get started by sharing link of my tutorial: [https://sagarkalyan.github.io/react-native](https://sagarkalyan.github.io/react-native/)

I have started my project with the website providing documentation.
[https://facebook.github.io/react-native/](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/)

My First Step of tutorial was to Set Up Installing softwares like Node, the React Native command line interface, Python2, a JDK, and Android Studio.
I successfully completed my task by running my application on mobile device. My app is ready to for the development of basic templates just now. I followed step by step to make it work properly.

Problem Occurred:
There was an issue related to running an app on mobile device while connected to the laptop through USB. I had difficulty in finding the solution for it. After searching a lot on google, i managed to solve the problem of gradlew ( Command failed: gradlew.bat installDebug )
So the solution was that i didn't give the path properly in environment variables (Security in Control panel option).

Next week:
I will start learning some basic concepts to understand the code.
first thing is to learn Components,
To make components do more interesting things, i need to learn about Props, state and style.
