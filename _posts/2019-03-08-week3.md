# [Week 3rd Project on React Native]({% post_url 2019-03-08-week3 %})

Hi, As far as it has been great learning platform for me, to develop mobile application.
I have learned and build a basic popup interactive functionality, so we can create some cool stuff.


There was some problem in understanding the basic concepts, to get familiar to the code. It's taking time to be good at it.
Still everything is good enough.

Next Week:
This time i will learn to build and show something cool interactive screen.
It will be a single page application with great features on it. for e.g. Using - Images, logos, using buttons for pop up activities.
I have to continue and cover some work which i gave in my previous post. For e.g. option to expand and shrink component size (Images).
