# [WEEK 5th Project on Personal Blog]({% post_url 2019-02-08-week5 %})

I have completed my Personal Blog mainly focused on Python and using Django.

### Work I have done this week:
1. Additionally used Pagination and developed the theme homepage.
2. I have revised the whole project, and also added two new pages (eg. blogs and aboutme page).

### Issue: 
I got my Django stopped working, couldn't figure out happened. It showed some errors like
(Python version () not installed.)
So, I ended up to install again, might be it was because of some changes in configuration django project.
Now its working right.

### Plan For My Next Week:
As, I have done this project. So i am excited to start learning React. which is also completely new for me to learn.
React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

I hope it will be also useful for me to make Mobile application in future. As React Native is also used to build native apps.

(Later when researched on google, React Native was my best choice to start my project on building a mobile app for the first time.) 

thanks.
