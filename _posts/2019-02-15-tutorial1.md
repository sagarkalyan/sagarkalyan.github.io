# [Tutorial Project on React Native]({% post_url 2019-02-15-tutorial1 %})

Hi I am Sagar Kalyan. This is my first Post on my project B Tutorials on React Native.

I have chosen this topic of my best interest because of several reasons:
My main purpose for choosing this topic is to build mobile application for the individual creators such as youtubers.

React native is a real mobile application. It's not a mobile web application, because it uses
the same fundamental UI building blocks as regular iOS and Android apps. Instead of Using java or swift, it uses javascript and react.
Many popular companies uses this framework to build native mobile apps.

The main reason is to build this project is to make my first mobile application and release it on google store.
It will help me in getting a job based on this profile. And this is going to be different platform for my self to share information.
So that i could also inspire many people and share whatever i have learnt in life. And also build an applications for them.

I will start with Learning Tutorials, and reading documentation on thier official website. And also watch some videos on youtube or lynda.com
to get some basic knowledge of coding.

I hope this project will also be useful for me in real life as well. thanks
