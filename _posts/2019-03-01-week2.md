# [Week 2nd Project on React Native]({% post_url 2019-03-01-week2 %})

This is My second week and everything is working good. I have installed react native and running successfully on mobile device.
I have learned some basic knowledge to try some built in components.

For e.g. <View>,<Text>. Props, State.
I have also learned some styles. For e.g. text can be bigger, we can also change the color and do lots of styling as we do in css.
Then i learned some properties of using flex dimension in which we has the option to expand and shrink component size, similarly like we do in html and css. There are lots of experimenting things which i did this week.
  
  
Next week:

I will learn some interativity with the simple layouts containing buttons. On pressing, an action would apply and show some pop up activities.
The topic covers Handling Touches, in which users interact with mobile app mainly through touch.
