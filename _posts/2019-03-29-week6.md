## [Week 6th Project on React Native]({% post_url 2019-03-29-week6 %})

This week I have done my tutorials completed on time. I am really happy to share my tutorials and its good helpful resource for any beginners to start now developing a cool application.
I have learned to make a basic application, which contains two navigation screens and designed beautifully to make it interactive for the user. It contains Review features also showing alert box to give reviews, just on the front-end layout.


Therefore, Running the Application Successfully. We accomplished our task for this tutorial on React Native.
Hopefully, It was easy understood.
