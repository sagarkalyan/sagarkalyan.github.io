# [Week 5th Project on React Native]({% post_url 2019-03-21-week5 %})

This week, i am almost done with my project creating an app for my self as creator.
Whatever i have learned, i am sharing through building this application.
This week, it took lots of time for me to write tutorials, and step by step making it proper.
there are few things to add like screenshots, and some few instructions to complete it.

This week, I also learned to make diferent screen like we can navigate from one screen to another.

[REACT NATIVE Navigation](https://reactnavigation.org/docs/en/hello-react-navigation.html "React Navigation")

[Navigating between Screens](https://reactnavigation.org/docs/en/navigating.html)


Issues:
I am facing some problems in copying and pasting the code to tutorials page, as some of the code content goes missing, i hope it is solved on time. Rest of the things are going fine.

Next Week:
I will be completing my tutorials on adding logo icon for my application and do some modification if possible without effecting the tutorial. I am happy to share my application project tutorial very soon.

thanks
