# [Week 4th Project on React Native]({% post_url 2019-03-15-week4 %})

Hi, It's been a great learning path to cover up the react native tutorials, where all things are simply build up similar like html and css.
So, I went through one of easy things to build like Text, View, Height and width, styles, Layout with flexbox, handling touches and some more. Then there were some complex things to learn which were completely new to me, Such as Props, State, Building up User Interface.

One of the main problems i got is that i didn't get the most apporpriate tutorial for the projects i have chosen, So i am learning through their official github based website. 
[REACT NATIVE BASICS](http://facebook.github.io/react-native/ "React Native")
They have provided some example apps on GitHub.
[More Recources](http://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/more-resources "React Native - More Recources")

It's been a good help to take which i am going to run some of them this week upcoming.

The next week is really important for me, one of my good experience to learn react native basics will definitely help me in making a good tutorial for this project. I have to write down the tutorial on my blog page. Overall, I hope it's going to be good and make my tutorials on time.

Thanks
